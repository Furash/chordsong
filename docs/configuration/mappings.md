# Chord Mappings

Every chord mapping consists of the following properties:

- **Chord**: The key sequence (e.g., `g g`).
- **Label**: The name shown in the overlay.
- **Icon**: A font icon (Nerd Fonts) to display next to the label. Can be any symbol supported by the font.
- **Group**: Optional category to organize your overlay into sections.
- **Context**: The Blender editor where the mapping is active (3D View, Shader Editor, etc.).

## Mapping Types

Each chord mapping type has its own set of attributes and configuration options.

Mapping type can be switched by clicking one of the icons in the mapping item.
