# Mappings

Configure chord mappings for operators, properties, scripts, and context toggles.

## Adding Mappings

There are several ways to create chord mappings:

- Right-click on operators or properties in Blender's UI
- Use the "Add Mapping" button in preferences
- Extract from the [Info Panel](../features/info.md) for batch creation from operator/property history

## Mapping Types

- [Operator Mapping](mappings/operator.md)
- [Property Mapping](mappings/property.md)
- [Toggle Mapping](mappings/toggle.md)
- [Script Mapping](mappings/script.md)
