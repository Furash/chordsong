## Operator Mapping

You can map any blender operator to a chord if it's path starts with `bpy.ops.`.
There are three ways to add an operator mapping:

1. Use the right mouse menu on any operator in the 3D View, Shader Editor, UV Editor or Geometry Nodes editor.

    ![Add Chord RMB](../../scr/add_chord_rmb.png){ width="240" }

2. Use the "Add Mapping" button in the Chord Song preferences panel.

    ![Add Mapping](../../scr/add_chord.gif){ width="640" }

3. Extract from the Info panel - select operator history text and use the context menu. See [Info Panel workflow](../../features/info.md) for details.

### Overview

Operator mappings execute Blender operators when their chord sequence is triggered.
