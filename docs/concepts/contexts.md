# Contexts

Contexts determine where chord mappings are active.

## Overview

Each mapping can be assigned to a specific Blender editor context. This allows you to have different chord sets for different workflows.

## Available Contexts

- **3D View (Object)**
- **3D View (Edit)**
- **Geometry Nodes**
- **Shader Editor**
- **UV Editor**

## Context Detection

The context is detected automatically based on the mouse position.

To have identical chord in multiple contexts, you have to duplicate the mapping and change it's context.
But same chord can be mapped to different operators in multiple contexts.
