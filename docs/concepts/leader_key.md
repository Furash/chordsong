# Leader Key System

The leader key is the foundation of Chord Song's interaction model.

It acts as a prefix that activates Chord Song's chord capture mode. Pressing the leader key opens the overlay and begins listening for chord sequences. 

Pressing the leader key again will open the Recents menu. 

Pressing the leader key again will execute the most recent chord.

## How It Works

## Setting the Leader Key

The leader key is the starting key for all chord sequences.

1. Go to the Chord Song preferences.
2. Find the **Leader Key** setting.
3. Click to map a key you want to use (e.g., `SPACE`, `CAPS_LOCK`, `Q`).
